            <p>Hello!! My name is Chris Rarig. I am a Senior Mortgage Data Specialist
                at Zillow Group in Lincoln,NE. I am currently working remotely just outside 
                of Lincoln,NE where I live with my wife. My career background is in Business Analytics.
                Prior to starting my career I attended Peru State College where I recieved a 
                degree in Mathematics. When I am not sorting through mortgage data points I enjoy
                reading, watching movies, and playing with my dog Lana. I hope that during this
                Code Fellows experince I fulfill my goals of mastering JavaScript, completing all courses,
                and attaining a software engineering position. 
            </p>
